                                            Flash (and similar applications) memorises the settings, preferences, and use of those contents through technology similar to Cookies. 
                                            However, " Adobe Flash PlayerTM " manages this information and your choices through a different interface from that provided by your browser software.
                                            As your Device may view content developed with the Flash language, access your Flash Cookies management tools, from the website http://www.adobe.com/fr.</p> 


                                        <h6>c.    Your choices expressed online on inter professional platforms</h6>
                                        <p>You can log on to the website http://www.youronlinechoices.com, provided by the digital advertising professionals joined in the European association EDAA (European Digital Advertising Alliance) and managed in France by the Interactive Advertising Bureau France.
                                            Thus you can know the Company registered to this platform which offer you the possibility of rejecting or accepting the Cookies used by these companies to adapt the advertisements that may be displayed on your Device to your browsing information: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies/. 
                                            This European platform is shared by hundreds of online advertising professionals and is a centralised interface where you can reject or accept Cookies likely to be used to adapt the advertisements that may be displayed there to the browsing of your Device. Note that this procedure will not prevent the display of advertisements on the websites you visit. 
                                            It will only block technologies that make it possible to tailor advertisements to your interests.</p>


                                        <h6>3.    WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF SEEING ADVERTISEMENTS ADAPTED TO YOUR BROWSING?</h6>
                                        <p>The purpose is to show you the most relevant advertisements possible. 
                                            For that purpose, Cookies technology makes it possible to determine which advertisement to display to a Device in real time, according to 
                                            recent browsing on one or several websites.
                                            Your interest in the advertising content displayed on your Device when you visit a website often 
                                            determines the advertising resources of the latter to exploit its services, often provided to users free of charge. You probably prefer 
                                            to see advertisements that match your interests rather than advertisements that are completely irrelevant to you. Similarly, Advertisers 
                                            who wish to see their advertisements distributed, are interested in posting their offers to users who may be most interested in them.</p>


                                        <h6>4.    SHARING THE USE OF YOUR DEVICE WITH OTHER PEOPLE</h6>
                                        <p>If your Device is used by more than one person and if the same Device has more than one browsing software, we cannot be sure that the

                                            Sharing the use of your Device with others and configuring your browser settings for Cookies is your free choice and responsibility.</p>

                                        <p>The Agencies may:</p>

                                        <p>design profitable advertising offers for the Broadcaster and for themselves and of increased effectiveness for the Advertiser;
                                            implement technological solutions and partnerships to collect information related to the browsing and/or the localisation of a single 
                                            Device (computer, smartphone) on one or several thousand advertising media (websites, mobile service platforms, mobile applications) of which they are 
                                            the direct or indirect intermediaries.</p>


                                        <p>« Broadcaster» : the editing medium of a content (website, mobile website or mobile application), which has advertising space that it seeks to 
                                            remunerate under the best possible financial and ergonomic conditions, by inserting advertising content, to finance its activities, in particular 
                                            the publishing of services and content or information (example: online press).</p>
                                        <p>To promote its advertising space and obtain better income from them, the Broadcaster must be able to justify an audience to supply its spaces with 
                                            advertising content adapted to that audience.</p> 
                                        <p>It can rely on one or more advertising agencies to promote its spaces. If necessary, these Advertising Agencies are required to implement counting 
                                            devices in the advertising space they market to Advertisers, and, if they have them, devices for adapting the advertising content they will display or 
                                            broadcast on the Broadcaster's website.</p>

                                        <p>"Targeted Advertising Provider": a company that uses technologies -including Cookies and/or probability or appetence calculation algorithms- to assist 
                                            an Advertising Agency, an Advertiser or a communication consultancy agency, in the determination of the advertisement that appears most suitable for the 
                                            Device browsing Information or the Personal Data relating to a user, according to the information that it processes or is made available by one of these players.</p>

                                        <p>« Targeted Advertising » :  ability to adapt advertising content to Browsing information or Personal Data.</p>

                                        <p>"Behavioural Advertising":  the advertising which consists of deducing the supposed interests of the users from information relating to the Browsing 
                                            of their Device on one or more services, to display  specifically adapted advertisements to them, supposed to interest them more than other advertisements.
                                            The implementation of this type of advertising depends, on the one hand, on the technologies used and the players who implement them, and on the other hand, 
                                            the availability or not of a "connection indicator" of a Device ("Cookie" file, for example) and the possibility or not to share such a "witness" with third parties.</p>

                                            he/she has entered, for example by registering for a service. 
                                            The implementation of this form of targeted advertising may result either from declarative information provided by a user but insufficient to identify 
                                            him/her (age, gender, tastes, interests) or from personal data processing. In the latter case, it must be apprehended in light of the regulations on 
                                            the protection of Personal Data, by informing Internet users, when they provide Personal Data about themselves, about the purposes of its processing, 
                                            including the adaptation of advertising content likely to be displayed to them.</p>
